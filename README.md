# Voice control for OpenAI Model and for Youtube API

The original idea is to give a "voice" to the model text-davinci-003 for my discord bot in order to ask question to the model and to play music in the voice channel all this using just the voice, I upload the code in this way because I also made it to work on the CLI. In case you wanna use it, feel free to do it! Just let me know what cool stuff are you creating! Also if you have any question just let me know!
